# Visual-textual-tweets-retrival
This project presents an automatic approach to labelling on-topic social media posts using a visual-textual fused vector. Two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the Inception-V3 CNN and word embedded CNN, are applied to extract visual and textual features, respectively, from social media posts. Well-trained on our designed training sets, the extracted visual and textual features are further concatenated to form a fused feature to feed the final classification process.

## Getting Started

This implementation is based on Python coding environment. A high-level neural network API, Keras (https://keras.io/), is used to enable fast experimentation. The code requires python 3.6 compiler and the installation of Keras with TensorFlow backend. The authors recommend the usage of GPU-supported TensorFlow to reduce the training time. 

## Prerequisites

Python 3.6.5

GPU supported TensorFlow

CUDA v9.0

## Training word2vec

## Training word embedded CNN

## Transfer learning Inception V3

## Fused CNN 

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
